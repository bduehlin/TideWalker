For use on phone-sized devices.

## Demo

### Landing

When you first open the app you are greeted with a prompt to search for a location or use your device's current location. This is your first glimpse at the blue and orange color scheme and the wave animation at the top.

### Tide Data

After getting your location, the app will either use the coordinates from your device or a geocoded version of your input to find the closest tide data station and display data to you. 
The app will prompt you to make this location your "default," and every subsequent time you open the app the tide data for that location will be displayed.

### Navigation

After settling on a default location, you will see the tabs along the bottom of the page, a Home tab to see the tides at your default location, a Search tab to see the tides anywhere and set a new default, and an About tab with some information about the app.

### Future Features

I plan to add graphing of tides for a more comprehensive look at how the tides will change in the short and long terms.
